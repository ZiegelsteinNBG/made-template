## Title
### Comparative Analysis of Green House Gases in Republican and Democratic States Across the United States

## Main Question
1. Does CO2 emission of US states vary with party affiliation?

## Description

Climate change has become a focal point for both major U.S. political parties, each proposing distinct approaches to greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. The Democratic Party generally advocates for increased renewable energy adoption and stricter GHG emissions regulations. Conversely, the Republican Party often favors economic incentives and market-driven solutions, focusing on gradual transitions. Given these policy differences, this analysis seeks to explore whether CO2 emissions vary between states based on political affiliation.

To conduct this analysis, we will use two primary datasets:

    The 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Results by State to determine political affiliation.
    Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Location, which provides CO2 emissions data by state.

This study will assess correlations between political leadership and state-level GHG emissions, without assuming causation. Additional factors, such as population density and energy infrastructure, will be considered in the discussion to provide context for the analysis. This approach aims to offer insights into how emissions may vary across U.S. states governed by different political parties and to suggest areas for future, more comprehensive studies.
